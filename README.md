The Siren’s City

Differences:

Art assets
I changed the setting from a forest to a city, because I felt it suited both the music and gameplay more. I also liked the sound of the title better.

Gameplay
Instead of having a dash input, I opted for a “fast land” movement option. I noticed when testing the platforming with the beat it was difficult to time landing with the music without falling.
The obstacles change according to the beat of the music. Background music is an integral gameplay element, so it will be playing. 

Your movement options are running, jumping, double jumping, and fast landing. You can interrupt a fast land with your double jump to reposition yourself.

Game flow
I had to lower the scope, so I ended up only creating one level with mechanics.

Checkpoint system
Checkpoints are denoted by mailboxes. You start at a mailbox, you have a checkpoint at a mailbox, and you finish at a mailbox.

Timer
There is a timer that tracks how long it takes to finish the level. Once you finish, the timer pauses.

Sound
Music is gotten from online and so are the sound FX used in jumping, fast landing, and reaching the checkpoints/goals.
